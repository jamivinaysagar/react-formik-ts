# React / Typescript / Formik / Redux test

> You are encouraged to "Google" solutions and read documentation, but do not copy and paste any code examples into your solution.

1. Create an input component in React+TypeScript that accepts 1 or more props that are type-checked. The placeholder file is already defined in Component.tsx

2. In App.tsx, connect the input to Formik in order to submit the input as part of a form.

3. When submitting the form, dispatch the data to a redux store so that it is persisted.

BONUS:

a. Add comments to your code to explain behaviour
b. Validate form with Yup.
c. Replace the input with @material-ui/core/TextField component and apply some custom styles (using MUI's css-in-js API)
d. Write a Jest test to test the behaviour end to end (using React Testing Library)
